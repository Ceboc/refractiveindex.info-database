<h1>Oleic acid, C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>34</sub>O<sub>2</sub></h1>
Oleic acid is a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid commonly found in various animal and vegetable fats and oils. It is a colorless or pale yellow liquid at room temperature with a mild odor and taste. Oleic acid is widely used in the manufacturing of soaps, detergents, and lotions, and serves as an emulsifying agent in the pharmaceutical industry. In materials science, it is often utilized as a surfactant and in the synthesis of nanoparticles due to its ability to stabilize particles in solution.
