<h1>Bromotrichloromethane, CBrCl<sub>3</sub></h1>


Bromotrichloromethane (CBrCl<sub>3</sub>) is a chemical compound consisting of a carbon atom bonded to one bromine and three chlorine atoms. It typically presents as a heavy, colorless liquid with a sweet odor, somewhat reminiscent of chloroform. This compound is mainly utilized as a solvent, as well as in fire extinguishers and as an intermediate in chemical synthesis. Due to its high density and volatility, careful handling is essential. Bromotrichloromethane is also recognized for its environmental and health hazards, including potential carcinogenic effects, necessitating strict safety protocols during its use and disposal.
