<h1>Valeric acid, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub></h1>
Valeric acid is a saturated aliphatic carboxylic acid with a five-carbon chain. It is a colorless liquid with a pungent, unpleasant odor similar to that of old cheese or sweaty socks. Naturally occurring in the root of the Valerian plant (Valeriana officinalis), valeric acid is used in the synthesis of esters for perfumes and flavorings due to its strong aroma. In industrial applications, it serves as a chemical intermediate in the production of lubricants, plasticizers, and pharmaceuticals.
