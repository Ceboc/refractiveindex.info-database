<h1>Caprylic acid, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>2</sub></h1>
Caprylic acid is a saturated medium-chain fatty acid with an eight-carbon backbone. It is a colorless to pale yellow liquid with a slightly unpleasant, rancid odor. Found naturally in coconut oil and palm kernel oil, caprylic acid is used in the production of perfumes, dyes, and in the treatment of some bacterial and yeast infections due to its antimicrobial properties. It also serves as a dietary supplement promoting digestive health.
