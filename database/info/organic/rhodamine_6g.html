<h1>Rhodamine 6G, C<sub>28</sub>H<sub>31</sub>ClN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub></h1>

Rhodamine 6G is a synthetic dye belonging to the rhodamine family and is widely recognized for its intense fluorescence. It possesses a distinctive reddish-pink color and, when in solution, emits a yellow fluorescence. Rhodamine 6G has been extensively employed as a gain medium in dye lasers, thanks to its notable photostability, high fluorescence quantum yield, and capability to function in both continuous wave and pulsed modes. Furthermore, it has proven valuable in a range of applications such as in fluorescence microscopy, as a tracer dye in fluid dynamics studies, and in various biological and chemical sensing methodologies. The molecule itself contains a xanthene core, which imparts its chromophore properties, rendering it an efficient light absorber and emitter. When tuning the laser, the output wavelength can be adjusted based on the solvent used, allowing for versatility in applications. Additionally, as a fluorescent probe, it is particularly effective for studying dynamic processes within biological systems.
