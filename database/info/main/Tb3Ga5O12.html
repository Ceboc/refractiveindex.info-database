<h1>Terbium gallium garnet, Tb<sub>3</sub>Ga<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> (TGG)</h1>

Terbium gallium garnet (Tb<sub>3</sub>Ga<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, TGG) is a magneto-optical crystal that exhibits excellent transparency in the visible and near-infrared regions. Its high Verdet constant makes it a prime material for use in Faraday rotators and optical isolators, key components in lasers and other optical systems that require the prevention of back-reflected light. TGG is known for its low absorption loss and high thermal conductivity, making it ideal for high-power laser applications. These properties, combined with its mechanical stability, ensure its performance in demanding environments such as laser systems used in industrial, medical, and research applications.
