<h1>Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)</h1>

<p>Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) is a chemically modified cellulose polymer that is widely used as an excipient in pharmaceuticals, as a food additive, and in the production of personal care products, construction materials, and adhesives. It is a versatile, non-toxic, and semi-synthetic compound that offers a variety of functions such as thickening, gelling, film-forming, water retention, and as an emulsifier. HPMC is particularly valued in the pharmaceutical industry for its role in controlling the release of active ingredients in medications, serving as a binder in tablet formulations, and as a component of eye drops for its lubricating properties. In the food industry, it is used to improve texture and stability of products like ice cream, sauces, and baked goods. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is soluble in water at all temperatures, making it a highly effective and versatile ingredient in both industrial and consumer applications.</p>
