<h1>Methylammonium lead bromide, CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> (MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>)</h1>


<p>Methylammonium lead bromide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub>) is a hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite material noted for its outstanding optical properties and high efficiency in photovoltaic applications. This compound forms a crystalline structure that is effective in light absorption and electron-hole separation, making it highly advantageous for use in solar cells. Its refractive index and other optical characteristics are of particular interest for optical applications, including photovoltaic devices and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>

<p>While CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> shows great promise in advanced technological applications, it poses environmental and health risks due to its lead content. Additionally, its stability under environmental conditions remains a subject of extensive research, aiming to enhance its durability and safety for commercial use.</p>
